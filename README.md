# To-Do List Application

## Project Description

This project is a simple To-Do List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to create, manage, and delete tasks in an interactive and user-friendly interface.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that provides the structure for the application. It contains a single `<div>` with the ID `root`, where the app is rendered.
- **app.css**: The CSS file responsible for the styling of the application, including the background colors, text colors, and other visual elements.
- **app.js**: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for managing the to-do list items, including adding, removing, and toggling the completion status of tasks.
- **index.js**: The entry point JavaScript file that initializes the application and handles the rendering of the user interface.

## Installation

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks to the to-do list.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can remove tasks from the list.
- **Task Completion**: Users can mark tasks as completed, and completed tasks are visually distinguished from incomplete ones.

## File Details

### index.html
This file sets up the basic structure of the application using standard HTML. It includes a `div` with an ID of `root`, which is where the JavaScript will render the application's UI.

### app.css
This file contains the CSS classes that style the to-do list application. For example:
- `.mt-2`: Adds a semi-transparent background color.
- `.in-list`: Applies a specific text color to list items.

### app.js
This JavaScript file contains the main logic for the to-do list functionality. It manages task addition, deletion, and toggling of task completion status.

### index.js
The `index.js` file serves as the entry point for the JavaScript code. It initializes the app by rendering the initial UI into the `root` div in `index.html`.

## Usage

Simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser to start using the To-Do List application. Tasks can be added by typing into the input field and pressing "Enter." Tasks can be deleted by clicking a delete button next to each task, and tasks can be marked as completed by clicking on the task.
